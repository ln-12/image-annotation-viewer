# Image Annotation Viewer

![](images/screenshot.png)

This program is a small weekend project to display image annotations written in Kotlin. It provides very basic functionality. Currently, only the [PASCAL VOC format](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) is supported, but adding support for other formats should be easy (feel free to create a pull request!).
